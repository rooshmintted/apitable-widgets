# APITable Widget SDK Guide

> Build, run and ship custom widgets for APITable.

---

## 1  Overview
The `@apitable/widget-sdk` package provides **React-friendly**, fully-typed utilities that let you read & write datasheet data, render rich UI pickers and integrate with the live collaboration engine â€“ all from an isolated IFrame or a standalone page.

The SDK bundles:
* A **Redux** store that mirrors the APITable state you are allowed to see.
* **Model classes** (`Datasheet`, `Record`, `Field`, `CloudStorage`) with high-level CRUD helpers.
* A rich set of **React hooks** â€“ `useRecords`, `useField`, `useViewport`, â€¦ â€“ for reactive data binding.
* Re-usable **UI components** such as `ViewPicker`, `FieldPicker`, `CellValue`, `Filter`.
* **Message & subscribe** layer that keeps your widget in sync with the room-server.
* Helper utilities (upload, i18n, signature manager, etc.).

If you have used the Airtable blocks SDK you will feel at home â€“ but with more features around permissions, real-time OT and enterprise security.

## 2  Installation
```bash
pnpm add @apitable/widget-sdk
# or
npm i @apitable/widget-sdk
```
The SDK has **no peer dependencies** besides React (>=17) and will polyfill `ResizeObserver` automatically.

---

## 3  Bootstrapping a Widget
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { initializeWidget } from '@apitable/widget-sdk';

const HelloWidget: React.FC = () => {
  return <div style={{ padding: 24 }}>ðŸ‘‹ Hello from my widget!</div>;
};

// APITable will inject `__WIDGET_PACKAGE_ID__` at build time (widget-cli does this)
initializeWidget(HelloWidget, process.env.__WIDGET_PACKAGE_ID__);
```
During **development** the CLI serves the bundle on `http://localhost:5173/index.js` and hot-reloads both code & sandbox permissions.

Production widgets are distributed as static JS bundles that APITable downloads on demand via `loadWidget(url, packageId)`.

---

## 4  Core APIs
### 4.1 initializeWidget
```ts
initializeWidget(Component: React.FC, widgetPackageId: string): void
```
Registers a React component under the provided package-id so it can be mounted by the APITable host.

### 4.2 Models
The SDK exposes 4 high-level model classes. All methods **return promises** when they touch the network.

#### Datasheet
Property / Method | Type | Notes
--- | --- | ---
`id` | `string` | Datasheet id (e.g. `dstxxxxxxxx`)
`name` | `string` | Display name
`addRecord(valuesMap, position?)` | `Promise<string>` | Creates a single record
`addRecords(records, position?)` | `Promise<string[]>` | Bulk create
`setRecord(recordId, valuesMap)` | `Promise<void>` | Update one
`setRecords(records)` | `Promise<void>` | Bulk update
`deleteRecord(recordId)` | `Promise<void>` | Remove record
`deleteRecords(ids)` | `Promise<void>` |
`addField(name, type, property?)` | `Promise<string>` | Create column
`deleteField(fieldId, conversion?)` | `Promise<void>` |
`checkPermissionsFor*` | `IPermissionResult` | Nine different helpers that validate current user permissions before a call â€“ see **permissions** below.

#### Record
Property / Method | Type | Notes
--- | --- | ---
`id` | `string` |
`title` | `string \| null` | Primary field value (stringified)
`commentCount` | `number` |
`getCellValue(fieldId)` | `any` | Parsed value (see Field types)
`getCellValueString(fieldId)` | `string \| null` | Value coerced to string
`url(viewId?)` | `string` | Deep link that opens the record in APITable UI

#### Field
Property / Method | Type | Notes
--- | --- | ---
`id` | `string` |
`name` | `string` |
`type` | `FieldType` |
`property` | `any` | Type-specific meta (options, precision, â€¦)
`validateCellValue(value)` | `{ error?: Error }` |
`cellValueToOpenValue(value)` | `any` | Converts internal value â†’ open format
`openWriteValueToCellValue(value)` | `any` | Converts open format â†’ internal value

#### CloudStorage
Key/value storage scoped to **workspace** or **widget**.
Method | Notes
--- | ---
`getAsync(keys)` â€“ string or string[]
`setAsync(pairs)` â€“ record<string, any>
`removeAsync(keys)` â€“ string or string[]

### 4.3 Permissions helpers
`DatasheetOperationPermission` enum provides bit-masks for `AddRecord`, `EditRecord`, `DeleteRecord`, `AddField`, `DeleteField`.
Every mutation method has a `checkPermissionsFor*` counterpart returning:
```ts
interface IPermissionResult { acceptable: boolean; message?: string }
```

---

## 5  React Hooks
Import directly from the SDK â€“ they are **fully typed**:
Hook | Purpose
--- | ---
`useDatasheet(datasheetId?)` | Returns a `Datasheet` instance
`useRecords(datasheetId, opts?)` | Reactive list of `Record` âœ± follows current view & filters
`useRecord(recordId, datasheetId?)` | Single record
`useRecordsAll(datasheetId)` | All records (ignores view filters)
`useFields(datasheetId)` | All `Field` objects
`useField(fieldId, datasheetId?)` | Field by id
`usePrimaryField(datasheetId)` | First column of first view
`useActiveViewId(datasheetId?)` | Current view id
`useViewIds(datasheetId)` | All view ids
`useViewMeta(viewId, datasheetId?)` | View meta
`useViewsMeta(datasheetId)` | Meta of all views
`useViewport()` | Widget sandbox dimensions & scroll position
`useSelection(datasheetId?)` | Current user cell/record selection
`useActiveCell(datasheetId?)` | `{ recordId, fieldId }` of focused cell
`useExpandRecord()` | Imperative helper to open the native record detail dialog
`useSettingsButton()` | Control the gear icon visibility & click handler
`useCollaborators()` | Workspace users present in the sheet
`useCloudStorage(scope?)` | Key/value storage wrapper described above
`useSession()` | Current user session information
`useUnitInfo()` | Unit / organization info

> **Tip:** All hooks automatically unsubscribe when the component unmounts â€“ no need for manual cleanup.

---

## 6  UI Components
Component | Description
--- | ---
`<ViewPicker>` | Dropdown to choose a view (grid, kanban, â€¦)
`<FieldPicker>` | Dropdown to choose a field. Accepts `allowedTypes` & `disabledTypes` props.
`<CellValue value field />` | Renders a cell just like the native UI (read-only).
`<Filter>` | Helpers to build filter conditions matching APITable query language.

All components are theme-aware and rely on Ant Design.

---

## 7  Enums & Types
### 7.1 FieldType
```ts
enum FieldType {
  NotSupport,
  Text,
  Number,
  SingleSelect,
  MultiSelect,
  DateTime,
  Attachment,
  OneWayLink,
  TwoWayLink,
  URL,
  Email,
  Phone,
  Checkbox,
  Rating,
  Member,
  MagicLookUp,
  Formula,
  Currency,
  Percent,
  SingleText,
  AutoNumber,
  CreatedTime,
  LastModifiedTime,
  CreatedBy,
  LastModifiedBy,
  Cascader,
  WorkDoc,
  Button,
}
```
Each field type section inside the SDK source (`src/interface/field_types.ts`) explains **read / write formats**, property schema and examples.

### 7.2 Other notable enums
* `ViewType` â€“ Grid, Kanban, Calendar, â€¦  (`src/interface/view_types.ts`)
* `DatasheetOperationPermission`
* `WidgetLoadError`

---

## 8  Utilities
Function | Location | Purpose
--- | --- | ---
`upload(file, opts?)` | `utils/upload` | Smart uploader that picks S3/minio & attaches metadata
`t(key, params?)` | `utils/i18n` | Tiny wrapper around `@apitable/i18n-lang`
`errMsg(message)` | `utils/private` | Generates **IPermissionResult** with `acceptable=false`
`assertSignatureManager` | `helper/assert_signature_manager` | Batch generate secure attachment signatures
`Script.*` | `script` namespace | Helpers dedicated to **Formula scripting runtime**

---

## 9  Message & Subscribe Layer (advanced)
Internally the SDK opens a websocket connection (Colla Engine) per datasheet and keeps a client-side Redux store in sync. You usually donâ€™t have to touch this but it is available:
* `subscribeDatasheetMap(store, { instance })`
* `subscribeWidgetMap(store, { instance })`
* `cmdExecute(name, params)` â€“ low-level command executor

---

## 10  Error Handling
The SDK ships a ready-to-use `<ErrorBoundary>` and a helper `showPermissionError` exported from `error_message.ts`.

---

## 11  Developing & Debugging Widgets
1. `pnpm add -g @apitable/widget-cli`
2. `widget-cli init my-widget` â€“ scaffolds a Vite + TypeScript project
3. `pnpm dev` â€“ serves the bundle and prints the `bundleUrl`
4. Paste the dev URL into the *Add Widget* dialog inside APITable â†’ your widget will hot-reload.

Widget CLI â‰¥ **v1.4.0** is required (checked at runtime via `checkCliVersion`).

---

## 12  Auto-generated API Reference
Running `pnpm --filter widget-sdk run docs` executes `packages/widget-sdk/docs.js` which uses **TypeDoc + typedoc-plugin-markdown** to generate fully-typed markdown docs under `dev-book/docs/widget/api-reference/`.

For exhaustive method signatures refer to those docs â€“ this guide focuses on the big picture.

---

## 13  License
The Widget SDK is released under the **GNU AGPL v3** â€“ see [LICENSE](LICENSE-EMBEDDING) for details.

## 14  Key Development Learnings

This section summarizes practical lessons learned while building widgets, which can help avoid common pitfalls.

### 14.1  Always Target the Active View

A common issue is a widget reporting different data (e.g., "0 records") than what is visible in the datasheet. This almost always happens when the widget is not scoped to the user's active view.

**Problem:** Using `useRecords(datasheet.id)` fetches records from a default or inactive view, which may not match what the user is currently looking at.

**Solution:** Always get the active view ID first, and then pass it to any hooks that fetch data. This ensures your widget operates on the exact same data context as the user.

```tsx
import { useDatasheet, useActiveViewId, useRecords, useFields } from '@apitable/widget-sdk';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const datasheet = useDatasheet();
  const viewId = useActiveViewId(); // âœ… Get the active view ID

  // âœ… Pass the viewId to data hooks
  const records = useRecords(viewId); 
  const fields = useFields(viewId);

  // ... rest of your component logic
};
```

### 14.2  Check Permissions Before Acting

To build a robust and user-friendly widget, always verify that the user has the necessary permissions *before* attempting a data-modifying operation like adding, updating, or deleting records. The SDK provides helper methods directly on the `datasheet` object for this purpose.

**Benefit:** This prevents operations from failing unexpectedly and allows you to show a clear, informative error message to the user.

**Example:**

```tsx
import { useDatasheet, useRecords } from '@apitable/widget-sdk';
import { useCallback } from 'react';

// ...

const datasheet = useDatasheet();
const recordsToDelete = useRecords(viewId);

const handleDelete = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!datasheet || recordsToDelete.length === 0) return;

  // âœ… Check for delete permissions on the first record as a representative sample
  const check = datasheet.checkPermissionsForDeleteRecord(recordsToDelete[0].id);

  if (!check.acceptable) {
    // Inform the user they can't perform this action
    alert(`Permission Denied: ${check.message}`);
    return;
  }

  // Now, it's safe to proceed with the deletion
  await datasheet.deleteRecords(recordsToDelete.map(r => r.id));

}, [datasheet, recordsToDelete]);
```

### 14.3  Component Library Usage

The APITable widget ecosystem uses components from two primary packages:

1.  `@apitable/widget-sdk`: Provides core data hooks (`useRecords`, `useFields`, etc.), foundational components like `FieldPicker` and `ViewPicker`, and UI feedback elements like `Toast`.
2.  `@apitable/components`: Provides a broader range of UI building blocks like `Button`, `IconButton`, `TextInput`, and `Typography`.

When a component is not found in one package, it is likely in the other. Referencing example widgets is a good way to determine where to import a specific component from.
